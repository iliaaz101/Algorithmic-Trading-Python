    "        - even if we know what's going to happen in the past data, we can't let the AT know\n",
    "    - the AT would start at the beginning of the historical data and using the rules that you gave it, it will buy/sell/and hold.\n",
    "        - in the end, we would get a report of how our algorithm performed in a **backtesting reform** which gives us metric based on our performance\n",
    "- after backtesting, once we deploy the AT on current time, it can use Past Data to inform current decisions\n",
    "    - **careful not to make assumptions about the unknown future of the market**\n",
    "        - developer assumptions about the market can create a biased AT\n",
    "        - e.g. hard coding prices for entry an exit imply future knowledge of proces\n",
    "            - buy 100 and sell for 200. We have no proof that the market would ever reach these prices, in which case the AT might not be executed\n"
